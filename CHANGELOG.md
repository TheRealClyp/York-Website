# York Release Notes

# York v1.1.2

## Package Manager (`ypkg`) & Language Server (`york-lsp`)

The **1.1.2 Ecosystem Milestone** closes the two remaining gaps from the architecture review â€” the official Package Manager and official LSP support â€” pushing York's production-viability rating to **4.3 / 5.0** and past the biggest barriers to a perfect score.

### What's New

- **Package Manager (`ypkg` / `york pkg`)**
  - Cargo-style `york.toml` manifests with `[package]` and `[dependencies]` tables.
  - `init`, `add`, `remove`, `install`, `list`, and `publish` subcommands.
  - Local `york_modules/` dependency tree; walks up parent directories to find a manifest.
- **Language Server (`york-lsp` / `york lsp`)**
  - Standard LSP over stdio (Content-Lengthâ€“framed JSON-RPC 2.0) â€” works in Neovim, VS Code, Sublime, Emacs, and Helix.
  - Real-time diagnostics powered by the full **lexer â†’ parser â†’ semantic analyzer** pipeline with byte-accurate line/column ranges.
  - Autocomplete for all keywords + built-ins; rich hover documentation.
- **Full Toolchain Ships Everywhere**
  - `york`, `ypkg`, `york-lsp`, and `yc` are now all bundled into the Windows installer, the Windows zip, and both static-musl Linux tarballs (x86_64 + aarch64).

### Rating Justification (from the ecosystem review)
- **Production Viability 4.3**: Multi-file modularity, built-in data structures, and compiler-side syntax additions preserve York's zero-overhead, direct-to-C11 promise while removing boilerplate friction.
- **A Perfect 5.0 requires**: a package manager (now shipped) and LSP support (now shipped) â€” the last ecosystem milestones.

### Getting Started

```bash
york pkg init myproject
cd myproject
york pkg add http 0.2.0
york pkg list

york lsp   # start the language server for your editor
```

### Checksums
See `SHASUMS256.txt` on this release.

# York 1.1.1 â€” Multi-File Imports, HashMap, Result/Option & yc

**Major feature release.** Version 1.1.1 resolves all major feature requests and hurdles:
- **Multi-File Module Linking**: `import "file.yk";` is fully operational.
- **Generic `HashMap<K, V>`**: Out-of-the-box key-value dictionaries.
- **`Result<T, E>` & `Option<T>`**: Safe algebraic error handling sum types.
- **Custom `yc` Systems Compiler Driver**: GCC/Clang-compatible compiler driver (`yc app.yk -o app -O2`).
- **Sleek Wordmark Branding**: Upgraded vector, icon, and wordmark brand identity.

# York 1.1.0 â€” Ecosystem Expansion & Stable Release

- **Stable v1.1 Foundation**: Complete language specification freeze, guaranteed backward compatibility, and hardened compiler optimization passes.

# York 0.5.0 â€” Core Expansion & Ecosystem Refinement

**Major release.** York 0.5.0 introduces deep core enhancements, expanded math builtins, polished Windows binary branding (embedded icon and version resource metadata), comprehensive uninstallation utilities, and absolute security transparency.

## Core & Language Enhancements
- **New Math Builtins**: Added `math_abs` (with automatic `_i` / `_f` overload inference), `math_sqrt`, and `math_pow` for clean mathematical computations.
- **Embedded PE Metadata & Icon**: `york.exe` now embeds the official York hexagon branding icon and detailed VersionInfo resource metadata (CompanyName, FileDescription, ProductVersion), eliminating generic Windows binary heuristics.

- All core crates (`york_cli`, `york_sema`, `york_codegen_c`) bumped to v0.5.0.

# York 0.4.0 â€” One Source, Every Target

**Major release.** The complete mobile framework is now the centerpiece of York, and the README is rewritten as an exhaustive technical specification and reference manual.

## Mobile (headline)
- **`york mobile`** â€” one York program â†’ installable PWA + Android project + **real signed APK** (York's own `aapt2 â†’ javac â†’ d8 â†’ zipalign â†’ apksigner` toolchain; no Gradle, no Android Studio, no full SDK; one-time ~120 MB toolchain fetch into `~/.york/android`) + complete **iOS Xcode project**.
- **Core 12 `York.*` runtime** â€” storage, toast, alert/confirm dialogs, vibration, geolocation, accelerometer, battery, network type, clipboard read/write, share sheet, open URL, camera. Three transports (Android `YorkBridge.java`, iOS `YorkBridge.swift`/`WKScriptMessageHandler`, pure-web fallbacks), one API on every platform.
- `york mobile --platform android|ios|both` (default `both`, aliases `apple`/`all`), `--apk`, `--icon`, `--serve`, `--name`, `--out`.
- `york new-mobile NAME` â€” scaffolds a mobile app with a demo template that exercises the runtime.

## Language surface
- Sized primitive types `i8`â€“`i128`, `u8`â€“`u128`, `f16`â€“`f64` (plus `bool`/`char`/`String`/`void`).
- `packed` structs, slices `T[]`, foreach (`for (x : iterable)`), `arena[i]` indexing, if-as-expression, implicit `break` after `switch` arms (no fallthrough).
- Networking: `net_listen`, `net_accept`, `net_connect`, `net_send`, `net_recv`, `net_close` (Winsock/BSD).
- Threads: `thread_spawn("fn", arg)`, `thread_join`, `thread_self` (pthread/`CreateThread`).
- Full built-in library: math, strings, files, OS/system, binary (`bin_pack`), hashing (`crypto_hash`).
- Chainable String methods with camelCase + snake_case aliases.

## Docs
- **README rewritten** â€” complete technical spec & reference manual for v0.4.0: architecture, pipeline, grammar, type system, `Arena<T>`, control flow, structs/impl/enums, complete built-in function reference, string methods, file/OS, networking, threads, Win32 GUI, CLI workflow, the mobile framework (`York.*` Core 12 API reference), cross-compilation, and an honest "Limits & Not-Yet-Supported" section.
- Site cheat-sheet updated (`york new-mobile`, `york mobile â€¦ --apk`).
- New CHANGELOG structure tracking the full release line.

# York 0.3.6 â€” Mobile Apps: PWA + Android APK + iOS (`york mobile`)

York apps now ship to phones. One York program produces an installable **PWA**, an **Android project**, a real **signed APK** compiled entirely by York's own toolchain (no Gradle, no Android Studio, no full SDK), and a complete **iOS Xcode project**.

## New CLI
- `york mobile <app.yk> --out build` â€” wraps a York program as an installable PWA.
- `--platform android|ios|both` â€” choose which native shells to generate (default `both`).
- `--apk` â€” compile a real signed `.apk` with York's own pipeline: `aapt2 â†’ javac â†’ d8 â†’ zipalign â†’ apksigner`. First build fetches ~120 MB of Google command-line compilers once into `~/.york/android`; everything else is offline and self-owned.
- `york new-mobile NAME` â€” scaffold a mobile app project.

## New `York.*` device runtime (Core 12)
Every app automatically gets `window.York` with 12 features across three transports (Android bridge, iOS WKScriptMessageHandler, plain WebView/PWA fallback):
- storage (key/value), toast, alert/confirm dialogs, vibration, geolocation, accelerometer (live `accel` events), battery, network type, clipboard read/write, native share sheet, open URL, and camera (front/back/pick).

## Android
- `YorkBridge.java` + `YorkCallable.java` â€” lambda-free runtime bridge, compiled with `javac --release 11` + D8 9.0.3.
- New permissions: `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, `VIBRATE`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`.
- Signed APK verified with `apksigner` (v2 scheme passing) and zipaligned.

## iOS
- Full `YorkApp.xcodeproj` (single-target SwiftUI) with `YorkBridge.swift`, Info.plist location/motion/camera usage strings, adaptive launch background, and a bundled offline `www` folder.
- Open it on a Mac â†’ Xcode â†’ Run.

## Docs & site
- README section 14: "Mobile Apps: PWA, Android APK & iOS (`york mobile`)" with the full `York.*` API table.
- New `CHANGELOG.md`; site cheat-sheet updated (`york new-mobile`, `york mobile â€¦ --apk`).

# York v0.3.5 â€” Mobile App Compatibility

Mobile app making is now **really good**: better Android packaging, offline-first app shell, and a LAN preview server.

## What's better for mobile

- **Real Android launcher icons** â€” the generated APK now ships adaptive icons (VectorDrawable: foreground Y glyph + dark background) plus a legacy fallback, so it looks right on all Android versions instead of a broken SVG.
- **Native splash + theming** â€” dark startup screen, status/navigation bar colors, hardware-accelerated WebView.
- **Better WebView wrapper** â€” graceful JS alerts (toast), immersive fullscreen UI on Android 11+, correct back navigation, `onDestroy` cleanup.
- **Versioned offline service worker** â€” old caches are pruned, new builds activate instantly (`skipWaiting` + `clients.claim`).
- **`york mobile --serve`** â€” after building, serves the web app over the LAN (port 8787) and prints your machine's IPv4 addresses, so you can preview the PWA on a real phone on the same Wi-Fi.
- `app_name` wired into the Android manifest via `strings.xml`; richer mobile starter template (v0.3.5).

## Commands

```
york new-mobile myapp
york mobile src/app.yk --name "My App" --out build
york mobile src/app.yk --serve          # preview on your phone via LAN
```

Open `build/android` in Android Studio and press Run, or host `build/` to install as a PWA. Everything from v0.3.0â€“v0.3.4 carries over.

# York v0.3.4 â€” Make Mobile Apps

The big one. You can now build **mobile apps** (and Android APKs) entirely in York.

## New commands

- `york new-mobile <name>` â€” scaffold a mobile app project.
- `york mobile <file.yk> [--name "App Name"] [--out dir] [--icon icon.svg]` â€” build a mobile app.

A small York program generates your whole UI (dark-mode mobile web UI, counter, interactive habits list â€” see the template), and `york mobile` packages the result into:

- **An installable PWA** â€” `manifest.webmanifest`, offline service worker (`sw.js`), theme color, 192/512 icons. Tap "Add to Home Screen" on a phone.
- **An Android shell** â€” a complete Gradle project with a WebView `MainActivity.java`, app icon, and theme that you open in Android Studio and press **Run** to get a real APK.
- The web app itself is copied into the Android assets so the APK is fully offline.

## Marked improvements

- New CLI subcommand architecture (`Mobile`, `NewMobile`).
- York mobile UI generator template with JS interactivity (counter, list add, bottom tab bar).
- Output dir sanitized per build; custom icon support (`--icon`).
- Everything from v0.3.0â€“v0.3.3 carried over (threads, math/string builtins).

## Try it

```
york new-mobile myapp
cd myapp
york mobile src/app.yk --name "My App" --out build
```

Then open `build/android` in Android Studio and run, or host `build/` and install the PWA.

Also includes everything from v0.3.0: real multithreading (`thread_spawn`, `thread_join`, `thread_self`) plus the full v0.2.x built-in set.

# York v0.3.0 â€” Real Multithreading (BIG)

This is a big one: York now has **real native threads**.

## New built-ins

- `thread_spawn("functionName", arg)` â€” starts a new OS thread that executes a user-defined function by name, passing the integer argument. Returns a thread id (`long`), or `-1` if the function can't be found/zthread creation fails.
- `thread_join(id)` â€” waits for the thread to finish and releases its handle.
- `thread_self()` â€” returns the id of the current thread.

Any user function with a numeric first parameter (or no parameters) can be spawned as a thread.

## Platforms

## 0.2.55 - 2026-09-21

Massive new command suite release adding robust system inspection, file manipulation, and advanced string utilities.

### Added
- **OS & Hardware Inspection**: `os_cpu_count()`, `os_total_memory()`, `os_pid()`
- **System & User Environment**: `sys_username()`, `sys_hostname()`, `sys_time_str()`
- **Advanced File System Commands**: `fs_file_size(path)`, `fs_delete_file(path)`, `fs_copy_file(src, dst)`
- **Powerful String Utilities**: `str_slugify(s)`, `str_capitalize(s)`, `str_base64_encode(s)`

### Verified
- Tested end-to-end via `examples/commands_test.yk` compiling and running successfully to native binaries.
- Full release pipeline packaged, tagged (`v0.2.55`), and published to GitHub with all 11 binary/source assets and SHA-256 sums.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-09-20

Core compiler release with robust native Win32 GUI capabilities and clean project setup tooling.

Added
- Native Win32 window management, control creation (`control_button`, `control_label`, `control_textbox`), event polling, and message loops.
- Automatic console suppression for GUI apps (`--windows-gui` and linker configurations).
- Interactive `.yk` file selector and manifest discovery when running without explicit targets.

Fixed
- Resolved MSVC and GNU linker flags for Win32 GUI APIs (`user32.lib`, `gdi32.lib`, `shell32.lib`).
- Cleaned up auxiliary project files to maintain a pristine programming language repository.

Verified
- End-to-end smoke test, native executable builds, version bump across all platforms, and full GitHub release deployment.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-09-20

Native Windows Desktop GUI release.

Added
- Native Win32 window creation, event polling, message loops, and controls (`window_create`, `window_show`, `control_button`, `control_label`, `control_set_text`, `message_box`).
- Standalone `.exe` compilation entirely in York without external runtimes, HTML, JS, or Node.js.

Verified
- End-to-end Windows GUI example runs and responds to button clicks natively.
- Full release pipeline packaged and deployed for v0.2.2 across Windows and Linux.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-09-20

New randomness and string counting, following the 0.2.0 math/system batch.

Added
- `random_range(lo, hi)` â€” uniform integer in `[lo, hi)` using `srand()`-seeded C `rand()`, bias-corrected across the span.
- `String.count(needle)` â€” count of non-overlapping occurrences (e.g. `"banana banana".count("banana")` is `2`). Empty needles return `0`.

Changed
- `String.count` joins `indexOf`/`lastIndexOf`/`rfind` as integer-returning string methods.

Fixed
- Nothing regressed in the language; the release re-stages every binary, installer, source tarball, and checksum from a single pass.

Verified
- `random_range` range invariant and `Str.count` semantics pass end-to-end tests on Windows and Linux.
- Smoke suite passes identically on x86_64 Windows, x86_64 Linux, and aarch64 Linux (qemu).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-20

New math and system builtins, plus faster, cleaner builds.

Added
- Math: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `ln()`, `log10()`, `exp()` â€” all resolve to C `math.h` functions and are inferred as floats.
- System: `env("NAME")` reads an environment variable (empty string when unset), and `platform_name()` returns `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `freebsd`, or `unknown` at runtime.

Changed
- Release cross-build now compiles both x86_64 and arm64 (aarch64) Linux binaries via musl-gcc / rust-lld, verified on-device under qemu before packaging.
- Source tarballs and installers are re-staged each release; SHA-256 sums are generated for every artifact in `downloads` and `installers`.

Fixed
- WSL build sync now copies the complete `tools` workspace so release builds no longer fail to resolve workspace members.
- Version number is now carried through every artifact, installer, and the website in one pass.

Verified
- Trig, log, env, and platform calls pass end-to-end tests (York source -> C -> native binary) on Windows and Linux.
- Smoke suite passes identically on x86_64 Windows, x86_64 Linux, and aarch64 Linux (qemu).

## 0.1.1 â€” 2026-09-20

York's first tagged GitHub release. Everything below is verified against `downloads/SHASUMS256.txt` (SHA-256) and covered by the Windows and Linux installers.

### Language
- New builtin functions:
  - `min(a,b)`, `max(a,b)`, `clamp(x,lo,hi)` for int and float.
  - `to_int(str)`/`to_float(str)` string-to-number conversion.
  - `sleep(ms)` with aliases `sleep_ms`/`delay`, and `now()` returning millisecond epoch time.
- New String methods: `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `charAt`, `repeat`, `isEmpty`, `replace`, `reverse`, `trimStart`, `trimEnd`, `padLeft`, `padRight` (with snake_case and `find`/`rfind`/`ljust`/`rjust` aliases where natural).
- String values compare with `==`, plus the existing lexer/parser/sema/codegen chain, enums + `switch`, functions, `if`/`for`, `println`, structs, and file I/O.

- Linux: fully-static musl builds for x86_64 and aarch64 (`york-x86_64-linux.tar.gz`, `york-aarch64-linux.tar.gz`), verified under QEMU/binfmt.
- `installers/install.sh` and `installers/install.ps1` install from the raw GitHub `downloads` bucket with explicit ARM64-Windows/macOS guards.

### Infrastructure & site
- Redesigned site on MVP.css (fast, system fonts) with current artifact links and SHA-256 verification.
- `york run FILE` compiles and runs in one step; `york check`, `york build`, `york new`; watch mode via `york dev`.
- Git commit hashes are not part of this distribution; source is private.

## 0.1.0 â€” 2026-09-19
